# Composing React Components

## Running this project

This project is set up with [Parcel Bundler](https://parceljs.org/), an npm package
that compiles our frontend assets and comes with an integrated development server.

The dev server runs on port `1234` by default, but will use another if `1234` is
being used by another application.

X- Clone the repo.
X- Navigate into the project folder.
X- Run `npm i` to download the project's dependencies listed in the `package.json`.
X- Run `npm start` to compile the project and spin up a dev server on `http://localhost:1234`.
